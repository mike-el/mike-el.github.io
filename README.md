## Weather data cube
Using the Met Office IRIS package, open a cube that contains many years worth of the Hadley sea surface temperature anomaly data, explore the dimensions and their ranges, select the most recent time slice, then visualise it using a color-brewer scale with coastlines displayed:

## Climate extremes
Using a long time series of multi-dimensional weather station data, load into a dataframe, remove missing numbers and non-numeric identifiers (eg estimated data), classify each month of the time series as an outlier or not based on the k-means cluster algorithm, then use the seaborn package to visualise the multi-dimensional data set with points labelled orange if they are classed as an outlier or not.
